# lab04

All of these questions deal with the ticket machine example. You should have it running while you work these exercises. 

# How can we tell from just its header that `setPrice` is a method and not a constructor?
```
public void setPrice(int cost)
```

# Complete the body of the setPrice method so that it assigns the value of its parameter to the price field. Write your new method here, including the method header. 

# Complete the body of the following method, whose purpose is to add the value of its parameter to a field named `score`.
```
/**
 * Increase score by the given number of points.
 */
public void increase(int points)
{
  ...
}
```
# Is the `increase` method in the previous question a mutator? If so, how could you demonstrate this?

# Complete the following method, whose purpose is to subtract the value of its parameter from a field named `price`.
```
/**
 * Reduce price by the given amount.
 */
public void discount(int amount)
{
  ...
}
```
